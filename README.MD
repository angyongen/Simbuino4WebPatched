This is a patched version of Simbuino4Web
https://github.com/Myndale/Simbuino


Simbuino4Web
==============
The Simbuino\src\Simbuino4Web folder contains an experimental HTML5 port of the core Simbuino engine developed for Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web. A
runtime version of this project is currently hosted at http://simbuino4web.ppl-pilot.com. It is recommended that you run this version of Simbuino under either Chome
or Firefox; it will work with Internet Explorer but runs very slowly and without sound.
